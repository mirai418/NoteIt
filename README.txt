MIRAI AKAGAWA 15-112 Term Project

*** IMPORTANT ***
This program is only designed to work on a mac, as it extracts data from the physical trackpad installed on the macbook.


*** HOW TO RUN ***

1. make sure the multiTouch.py file is in the same directory as the main program (NoteIt-v3.1.py)

2. install PIL - Python Imaging Library here: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

3. through a terminal shell or other, run the main program on python


*** General Function ***

This program tries to take the real note taking experience on to the digital world. By making the trackpad like a tablet, you can directly write on it (recommended use: stylus - although finger also works). The program, depending on the mode, will take the data from the trackpad device and display it as points on the canvas. In write mode, a document is started and it automatically compiles the words you write onto one document. Read more in the design document.
